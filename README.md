# CS465-FULLSTACK

In my full-stack project, I employed a variety of frontend development strategies, including Express-based HTML and JavaScript for traditional server-rendered web pages, as well as a Single Page Application (SPA) built with Angular. Express HTML and JavaScript are typically used to generate dynamic content on the server side, where data is injected into HTML templates before being sent to the client. This method is straightforward and effective for simple web applications that don't require extensive user interaction. Conversely, the SPA architecture with Angular offers a more dynamic and responsive user experience by loading a single HTML page and updating content dynamically on the client side without reloading the entire page. This approach allows SPAs to manage complex user interfaces and interactions more efficiently. The backend of the project used a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its flexibility in handling unstructured or semi-structured data, making it ideal for applications that need a scalable and adaptable schema.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that closely resembles JavaScript objects in syntax but is exclusively used for data representation. JSON is language-independent, which makes it an excellent format for exchanging data between the frontend and backend in a full-stack application. On the other hand, JavaScript is a programming language used for scripting and implementing logic on the client side. JSON plays a pivotal role in connecting the frontend and backend by enabling structured data to be exchanged in a format that both sides can easily parse and manipulate. Throughout the full-stack process, I refactored code multiple times to enhance functionality and efficiency, such as by abstracting repetitive logic into reusable UI components. This approach offers several benefits, including easier maintenance, quicker development, and a more consistent user experience across different parts of the application.

Testing a full-stack application requires various methods to ensure that API endpoints function correctly and securely. Endpoint testing ensures that the API routes respond as expected to requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Security layers add complexity, often requiring the handling of authentication tokens or encrypted data transmission, which must be managed appropriately during testing. Understanding these methods and endpoints is crucial because they define how the frontend and backend interact. Secure endpoints are essential for protecting sensitive data, while correctly functioning endpoints ensure the application's reliability.

This course has greatly contributed to my professional development by deepening my understanding of full-stack development and the interaction between frontend and backend technologies. Iâ€™ve honed and mastered essential skills, such as creating dynamic user interfaces with Angular, structuring and querying databases with MongoDB, and ensuring secure and efficient communication across different layers of a web application. These skills have made me a more competitive candidate in the job market by providing me with the tools necessary to build scalable, efficient, and user-friendly applications.
